        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
		
		
        <ol>
		<h3>Make the crème pâtissière:</h3>
            <li><p>Put the sugar, egg yolks, as well vanilla in an electric mixing bowl and mix it for about 3 minute and trail (should be 3-4 min). Now, add flour and whisk until you have a consistent mixture.</p></li>
            <li><p>Put milk into a medium sauce pan and heat it over medium heat for about 3 minutes until it boils. Blend the hot milk with the egg yolks gradually. Secondly, put the mixture back in the saucepan and boil it with constant stirring approximately 3 minutes. Stir and boil the mixture continuously for 1 additional minute. Place the mixture in a medium bowl and cover it with pressed plastic wrap. Allow the mixture to stand at room temperature for approximately an hour. It thereafter can be refrigerated and sealed for three days.</p></li>
		<h3>Make the crème pâtissière:</h3>
            <li><p>Insert the oven rack to its bottom side then heat your oven up to 375°F before putting in your pie. Put some sugar and flour in a different pot and reserve it. Finally, cut a piece of parchment 24 x 12 inches long and fold it three times along its length in order to obtain a strip wrapping around the outer top edge of a 1 quart souffle dish two inches above the rim. Ensure that the parchment paper is secured tightly, and string that cannot be broken should be used in this case. Afterward, you should smear the sides of the soufflé and parchment rings with melted butter before coating them lightly using the sugared dusting to avoid overburning of any sugar residues. To finish it off, allow the plate rest around 15 minutes.</p></li>
			<li><p>First, combine crème patisserie, gran marnier and orange zest in a bowl. Beat clean or fresh egg white to form glossy stiff peaks or high points using heavy duty beaters and a mixer at medium speed – approximately four minutes or so. Beat one half of the egg whites gently into the crema pasta siera, until everything is well mixed together. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites into the mixture and ensure that they are incorporated but not too smooth. Just now, pour it over your already created bowl. Place the dish onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a previously heated oven for 40 minutes – 45 minutes, or until the soufflé has puffed up and turned golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot.</p></li>
